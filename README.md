Sonos purchased Snips in 2019, and announced that the Snips Console will be
closed as of January 31, 2020.  By closing the Snips Console, Sonos has
indicated a desire to move Snips to a closed system.  I don't have any problem
with that.  However, having worked for a number of software and other
companies, I fear that Sonos' management was under the mistaken belief that all
of the software available for the Snips platform was part of their purchase.
This is not the case, as most of the software for the platform was developed by
other entities.  By revoking the license, I hope to make it clear to Sonos that
any copying, modification, use, or distribution of my software by Sonos is a
violation of copyright law.  If I learn that Sonos is distributing software
that is substantially similar, I will take all necessary measures to stop all
distribution unless and until it is proven that Sonos has not undertaken any
illegal activity in that distribution.

# Additional Software Licenses 
- ansi_up-LICENSE  License agreement for ansi_up.js, by Dru Nelson.
- mimic-COPYING License information for mimic.
- wait-for-it-LICENSE License agreement for wait-for-it.sh, by Giles Hall.

All other third-party software is installed through the Debian package
management tools.  As such, licensing information for that software should be
contained in the docker image.

Please note that when you install a snips assistant, additional third-party
software may be installed.  This third-party software should install any
additional, relevant license agreements.  These license agreements will
probably appear under /var/lib/snips/skills in the docker image.
